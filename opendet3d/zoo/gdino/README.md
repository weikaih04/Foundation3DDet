# Grounding DINO

## Getting Started

- Test the pre-trained G-DINO model on COCO
```bash
vis4d test --config opendet3d/zoo/gdino/gdino_swin_t_o365.py --gpus 1
```

- Train G-DINO with Objects365v1
```bash
vis4d fit --config opendet3d/zoo/gdino/gdino_swin_t_o365.py --gpus 8 --nodes 2
```

## Acknowledgement
