class HungarianMatcher:
    """Computes one-to-one matching between predictions and ground truth.

    This class computes an assignment between the targets and the predictions
    based on the costs. The targets don't include the no_object, so generally
    there are more predictions than targets. After the one-to-one matching, the
    un-matched are treated as backgrounds. Thus each query prediction will be
    assigned with `0` or a positive integer indicating the ground truth index:

        - 0: negative sample, no assigned gt
        - positive integer: positive sample, index (1-based) of assigned gt

        This method assign each query prediction to a ground truth or

        of assigned gt.
        The assignment is done in the following steps, the order matters.

        1. assign every prediction to -1
        2. compute the weighted costs
        3. do Hungarian matching on CPU based on the costs
        4. assign all to 0 (background) first, then for each matched pair
           between predictions and gts, treat this prediction as foreground
           and assign the corresponding gt index (plus 1) to it.

        Args:
            boxes (Tensor): Predicted boxes with normalized coordinates
                (cx, cy, w, h), which are all in range [0, 1]. Shape

            targets (Tensor): Ground truth boxes with unnormalized
                coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2). Shape [num_gt, 4].
            gt_labels (Tensor): Label of `targets`, shape (num_gt,).
            img_meta (dict): Meta information for current image.
            gt_bboxes_ignore (Tensor, optional): Ground truth bboxes that are
                labelled as `ignored`. Default None.
            eps (int | float, optional): A value added to the denominator for
                numerical stability. Default 1e-7.
